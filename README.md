# Mini Express Framework

## Overview

This is a class prject for [Prof. Joe Versoza](http://cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/)'s Applied Internet Technology course. The miniWeb.js file contains a web framework that is similar to the famous Express.js. This framework is created in order for me to have a better understanding of the HTTP communication and it is develpoved using the Node.js's net module. The fansite.js file is a mini web app developed using the miniWeb.js framework.

## To Run

No dependency is needed to be installed, but the machine needs to have node.js to run the site. To run, type **node src/fansite** in your terminal and open the site at **http://localhost:8080/**
